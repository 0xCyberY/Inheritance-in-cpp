�Public mode: If we derive a sub class from a public base class. Then the public member of the base class will become public 
in the derived class and protected members of the base class will become protected in derived class.
�Protected mode: If we derive a sub class from a Protected base class. 
Then both public member and protected members of the base class will become protected in derived class.
�Private mode: If we derive a sub class from a Private base class. Then both public member and protected members 
of the base class will become Private in derived class. Therefore, the public members of the base class are not accessible 
by the objects of the derived class only by the member functions of the derived class.

Note: The private members in the base class cannot be directly accessed in the derived class, while protected members can be directly accessed.
In C++, the default Access mode is private.
�The private members of the base class are never inherited.
