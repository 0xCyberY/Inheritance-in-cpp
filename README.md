# Inheritance-in-cpp
In C++, inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of its parent object automatically. In such way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviours which are defined in other class.


�The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.
�In C++, the class which inherits the members of another class is called derived class and the class whose members are inherited is called base class. The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.
�Inheritance is one of the most important feature of Object Oriented Programming. 

Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived Class. 
Super Class:The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or Super class.
