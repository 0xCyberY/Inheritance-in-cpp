-Single Inheritance: In single inheritance,
a class is allowed to inherit from only one class. i.e. one sub class is inherited by one base class only.
syntax:
class subclass_name : access_mode base_class
{
//body of subclass
};

-Multiple Inheritance: Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one classes.
i.e one sub class is inherited from more than one base classes.
syntax:
class subclass_name : access_mode base_class1, access_mode base_class2, ....
{
//body of subclass
};

-Multilevel Inheritance: In this type of inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class.

-Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance: Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by combining more than one type of inheritance. 
For example: Combining Hierarchical inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.

-Hierarchical Inheritance: In this type of inheritance, more than one sub class is inherited from a single base class.
i.e. more than one derived class is created from a single base class.
